# Task 5 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Titanic Dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to extract insights from the Titanic dataset using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Source:** [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data?select=train.csv)
- **File Used:** `train.csv`
- **Rows:** 891  
- **Columns:** 12 (Passenger details, class, fare, survival status, etc.)

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Loaded dataset with Pandas
   - Checked structure, missing values, and basic statistics
2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Histograms & boxplots for Age, Fare
3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Survival rate by Gender
   - Survival rate by Passenger Class
   - Age vs Fare distribution
4. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Pairplots
   - Correlation heatmap (numeric features)
5. **Observations & Insights**
   - Recorded after each plot
6. **Summary of Findings**
   - Concise conclusions based on patterns & trends

## ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
- Females had a much higher survival rate than males.
- 1st class passengers survived more often than lower classes.
- Higher fares correlated positively with survival.
- Younger passengers had slightly better chances of survival.

## ðŸ“¤ Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook:** `Task5_EDA.ipynb`
- **PDF Report:** `Task5_EDA.pdf`
- **Dataset:** `train.csv` (if allowed)
- **README.md** (this file)
